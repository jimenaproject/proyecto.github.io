<p id="e5">Original lyrics</P>
<br> 
<P id="hola">Verse1</P>
<p id="hole">I see trees of green, red roses too<br>
I see them bloom for me and you<br>
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world</P>

<P id="holi">Verse2</P>
<p id="holo">I see skies of blue and clouds of white<br>
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred night<br>
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world</P>

<P id="holu">Verse3</P>
<p id="e1">The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky<br>
Are also on the faces of people going by<br>
I see friends shaking hands, saying: How do you do?<br>
They're really saying: I love you!</P>

<P id="e2">Verse4</P>
<p id="e3">I hear babies crying, I watch them grow<br>
They'll learn much more, than I'll never know<br>
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world</P>
